To make this shareable between your PC in Malaysia and your wife's PC in Indonesia, weâ€™ll turn this into a **self-hosted web app** that you can both open over the internet. Hereâ€™s the first step (Option 1): setting it up as a simple local web server.

### âœ… Step 1: Save your project files
1. Create a new folder on your computer, e.g. `notey-app`.
2. Save your `index.html` (the code you already have) inside this folder.
3. In the same folder, create a `manifest.json` file with this content:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "UNiV & KazumiLocks Project",
     "short_name": "Notey",
     "start_url": ".",
     "display": "standalone",
     "background_color": "#ffffff",
     "description": "Private notes app for UNiV & KazumiLocks",
     "icons": []
   }
   ```

### âœ… Step 2: Run a local server
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Install the extension **Live Server** (by Ritwick Dey).
3. Right-click on `index.html` â†’ **Open with Live Server**.
4. Youâ€™ll now see your app running at something like:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5500/
   ```

This makes it work like a proper web app instead of just opening as a file.

### âœ… Step 3: Access from another PC (LAN first)
- If your wife is on the same WiFi/LAN (for testing), she can enter your **local IP address** + port in her browser.
   Example:
   ```
   http://192.168.0.5:5500/
   ```

ðŸ‘‰ Next step (to make it work **across countries**, Malaysia â†” Indonesia), youâ€™d need to put this app on a small **cloud server** (like Netlify, Vercel, or a cheap VPS). Then youâ€™d both access it with HTTPS safely.

Do you want me to guide you through **putting this online for just you two** (with a password, so nobody else can access it)? ðŸ”’
